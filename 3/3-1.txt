    <h1>Hacker Typing</h1>
    <p>In the early days of computers monitors, the screens could only show one colour on a black background, this colour was usually green or orange. The early computer interfaces had no graphics apart from text and no mouse or touch control, only keyboard input.</p>
    <p>To this day the <em>Green Screen</em> visual style of bright green text on a black background is a symbol for hackers and computer programmers, appearing in popular movies such as <em>The Matrix (1999)</em>.</p>
